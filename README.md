# Omy5

This repository is for the project entitled: Adaptive variation associated with O. mykiss life-history strategies (residency vs. anadromy) along its geographic range

The objectives of this project are:

1. To characterize the chromosome Omy5 region under selection and identify the physical linkage block.

2. To expand the number of populations to assess and monitor the influence of this genomic region on the expression of life-history strategies throughout the species range.
